# Python_Code_Showcase

This repository is a way to showcase some of my coding ability in Python.

* Begin with **Generate_Data**.ipynb to create fake random data as CSV files.
* Continue to **EDA**.ipynb to delve through this data and identify+clean out any issues in a programatic fashion.
* Next is **Feature_Engineering**.ipynb to handle final model-preparation on the data and some further feature engineering.
* Finally, the **Modeling**.ipynb notebook fits a basic linear model (and more sophisticated ones) and assess its fit, avoids any overfitting issues, and presents findings.

Since this project uses random noise to generate the data, the models here shouldn't find anything of use and the final step is simply for demonstration.
