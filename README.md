# Python_Code_Showcase

This repository is a way to showcase some of my coding ability in Python.

* Begin with Generate_Data.ipynb to create fake data as CSV files.
* Continue to EDA.ipynb to delve through this data and clean out any issues in a programatic fashion.
* Next is Feature_Engineering.ipynb to handle model-preparation and some further feature engineering.
* Finally, a modeling notebook will be created to fit a basic model and assess its fit, avoid any overfitting issues, and present findings.
